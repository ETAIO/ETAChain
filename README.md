# ETACHAIN - CROSS-BORDER BRIDGE CHAIN + AI ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE + BIG DATA

[Build status]

## 1.1 ETA Chain
As the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain, the ETA Chain chain is designed as a bridge linking different blockchain networks, which can directly convert ETH digital assets into other digital currencies under other ETH sidechains. Open links between blocks to bridge the transition between blockchains.

## 1.2 ETA
ETA Chain is a global cross-connect project initiated by senior developers of blockchains in Hong Kong, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries and regions. It has ultra-high performance and can realize low cost and low latency on different blockchain networks. The exchange of value, the cost of the cross-chain assets is faster than the exchange.

## 1.3 Technology
ETA Chain is a separate underlying public chain developed using the latest blockchain 3.0 technology to build a new artificial intelligence application based on the DPOS+POW consensus mechanism. EOS.IO graphene technology and virtual machine implementation contract, the first use of secure multi-party computing and threshold key sharing technology to achieve secure cross-chain transactions.

## 1.4 Team
The ETA Chain Founding Team is comprised of the world's leading experts and is a global cross-chain project initiated by senior developers of blockchains in various countries and regions.
